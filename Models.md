# SQLite3 and How to Use it in Python

## Introduction

SQLite3 is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained database engine that is widely used in various Python applications. It's a part of the Python Standard Library, which means you don't need to install additional packages to work with SQLite in your Python projects. This guide will introduce you to SQLite3 and show you how to use it effectively in your Python applications.

## Installation

SQLite3 is included in the Python Standard Library, so there's usually no need for separate installation. You can verify its presence by running the following code:

```python
import sqlite3

print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)
```

If you get a version number, it means SQLite3 is installed and ready to use.

## Creating a Database

To create a new SQLite database file, you can use the following code:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
conn.close()
```

This code establishes a connection to a new SQLite database file named `mydatabase.db`.

## Connecting to a Database

To connect to an existing SQLite database, you can use the following code:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('existing_database.db')
```

This code connects to an SQLite database file named `existing_database.db`.

## Creating Tables

You can design and create tables in your SQLite database using SQL statements. For example:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        department TEXT,
        salary REAL
    )
''')

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

This code creates an "employees" table with columns for employee ID, name, department, and salary.

## Inserting Data

You can insert data into your tables using SQL INSERT statements:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Insert data
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", ("John Doe", "HR", 55000.00))

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

This code inserts a new employee record into the "employees" table.

## Querying Data

Retrieve data from your database using SQL SELECT statements:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Query data
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
data = cursor.fetchall()

for row in data:
    print(row)

conn.close()
```

This code retrieves all records from the "employees" table and prints them.

## Updating and Deleting Data

Use SQL UPDATE and DELETE statements to modify or delete records in your tables:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Update data
cursor.execute("UPDATE employees SET salary = ? WHERE name = ?", (60000.00, "John Doe"))

# Delete data
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = ?", ("John Doe",))

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

This code updates the salary of an employee and then deletes the employee record.

## Transactions

SQLite3 supports transactions to ensure data consistency. Use `commit()` to save changes and `rollback()` to undo changes within a transaction.

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

try:
    # Start a transaction
    conn.execute("BEGIN")
    
    # Make changes
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", ("Jane Smith", "IT", 60000.00))
    
    # Commit the transaction
    conn.commit()
except:
    # Rollback the transaction if an error occurs
    conn.rollback()
finally:
    conn.close()
```

This code demonstrates how to use transactions for safe data manipulation.

## Using SQLite3 in Python

To interact with SQLite databases in Python, use the `sqlite3` library. It provides classes and methods for database connectivity, querying, and data manipulation.

```python
import sqlite3

# Establish a connection
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Use cursor to execute SQL statements
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
data = cursor.fetchall()

# Close the connection when done
conn.close()
```

This code showcases the basic usage of SQLite3 in Python.

## Best Practices

When working with SQLite3 in Python, consider the following best practices:

- Always close the database connection when you're done.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Ensure your database schema is well-defined and follows normalization principles.
- Use transactions when performing multiple related database operations.

## Examples

To help you get started, we provide practical examples in the "Examples" section of this guide. These examples illustrate common database operations and their implementation in Python.
